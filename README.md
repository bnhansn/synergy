> Thank you for purchasing Synergy!

We built this theme to help you get a professional looking website up quickly and easily. If this is your first time using Ghost we recommend reading through the Ghost installation instructions to get the blog software up and running. [http://support.ghost.org/installation](http://support.ghost.org/installation)

For beginners we recommend the [Ghost Pro](http://support.ghost.org/getting-started-ghost-pro) hosting service.

Once you have a Ghost blog up and running you can reference [this guide](http://support.ghost.org/switch-themes) for how to activate a new theme.
